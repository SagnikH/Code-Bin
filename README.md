# Code Bin
<h3 align = "center">A hastebin clone app</h3>
</br>

## Motivation
This was my side project while learning MongoDB and express js. At the time I was practicing DSA questions with my friends and sharing answers on whatsapp was becoming an issue. I cam across the Hastebin app and that led me to cloning this web app.

## Features
- Shareable code snippet link.
- You can even duplicate and edit an existing snippet and share again.
- A permanent storage for your important algorithms.

## Environment Variables
To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

#### SERVER
- `PORT` - 4000 (Port on which the server runs)

## Local Development
Clone the project
```
https://github.com/SagnikH/Code-Bin
```
Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
npm install -D
```
Start the server ( PORT: 4000 )

```
  npm start
```

## Future Plans
- Added google oauth2.
- Use data from google oauth to provide default template with timestamp in every snippet header.
